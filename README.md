## Personal statement

A passionate and self-driven individual currently looking to take his first steps into a career as a software developer. I have always been attracted to tools and hobbies that let me create new things and allow a lot of abstract thinking, anything from Lego, through watchmaking, to writing, and software development has been a natural progression from those things, but I did not get a chance to embrace it as more than a hobby until the recent pandemic. I’ve currently graduated from Makers Academy, a comprehensive industry-driven software development boot camp, and I am excited to apply the knowledge I gained during the course, alongside years of building soft skills as a manager in restaurants, to nurture what was once a hobby into a career in the tech field.


## Projects

| Name | Description | Tech/tools |
| - | - | - |
| [**Battle Tetris**](https://github.com/CKMurison/Tetris)  | -> Developed as part of the final engineering project at Makers Academy. View the presentation via [this link](https://youtu.be/poiWhBTU_ys?t=1954). <br /> -> A Tetris-inspired game with two players sharing a single board. <br /> -> A group project with the idea of using our previous knowledge to build the entire game logic using only the tools available by the vanilla language, without the help of pre-built libraries available. | JavaScript, DOM, HMTL/CSS, Jest |
| [**Acebook**](https://github.com/sharmine-s/acebook-airbenders) | -> A Facebook clone, with the basic post, comment, and friends list functionality implemented. <br /> -> Developed with the idea of the team being previously inexperienced with the MERN stack, therefore having to learn the relevant technologies and expand on the project in a limited amount of time. | React, MongoDB, Express, Node, Jest, Cypress |
| [**RuBnB**](https://github.com/michael-szczepanski/ruBnB) | -> An Airbnb-style website with basic functionality of advertising and booking a space, using PostgreSQL as its data management system. <br /> -> Developed as a first engineering project during the Makers Academy course, with the main focus throughout the project being on learning to work with Agile ceremonies and peer-review features. | Ruby, HTML/CSS, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, RSpec |
| [**2D Game Engine**](https://github.com/michael-szczepanski/mario-maker) | -> An ongoing solo research project, currently following a step-by-step guide with the intention of deep diving and researching low-level access to hardware functionalities using a Java game library. <br /> -> The project allows me to strengthen my coding abilities and learn best practices, and plan to leverage this knowledge in a more complex future endeavor | Java, LWJGL |

## Education

**Makers Academy** <br />
_Software Development Bootcamp  (March 2023 to July 2023)_
- Completed an intensive industry-focused 16-week course, with key highlights being:
- Working in an Agile environment, with the course as a whole, as well as individual group projects being broken down into sprints, with regular stand-ups and retros.
- Real-life projects, which allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, with a big emphasis on Test Driven Development, and using Git for version control.
- The importance of teamwork and collaborative skills. Daily pair programming, in a driver-navigator setting, was utilized heavily to improve our skills in being able to understand and explain the code that we were working on.
- A focus on continuous learning and independence. While access to instructors was available, I was strongly encouraged to seek answers to bugs and questions independently first, which improved my skills in problem-solving, as well as finding and parsing through relevant documentation.


**Queen Mary, University of London**<br />
_BSc in Astrophysics (September 2010 to July 2013)_
- My degree covered a range of subjects across physical sciences with a heavy focus on abstract thinking, data analysis, and statistics.
- My final dissertation was a research project on existing and upcoming observation techniques and technologies. This involved regular communication with my supervisors, as well as a verbal presentation in front of a panel of professors.


## Work Experience

**Goodman Steakhouse, London** <br />
_Senior Waiter (September 2020 to present)_
- Delivered excellent customer service in a restaurant dedicated to individual customers' needs, increasing the number of regular guests, and consistently excellent reviews.

**Ping Pong Dim Sum, London**  <br />
_Assistant Manager (June 2015 to May 2020)_
- Assumed full responsibility for optimizing the financial aspects of daily operations in a restaurant, as well as long-term budgeting, resulting in the business exceeding both its profit and revenue targets.
- Effectively managed payroll and paperwork for new hires, ensuring that the staff has been paid correctly, and on time.
- Conducted health, safety, and sanitation process evaluations to identify and remedy violations, resulting in the highest possible Food Hygiene Rating from the Food Standards Agency.
- Organized recruitment of new staff, and organized training sessions, to guarantee consistently high levels of customer service.

## Hobbies
- Currently learning how to play a keyboard and the Czech language
- I’ve been a member of the British Horological Institute, and the Royal Astronomical Society
